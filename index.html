                <p>Once I was asked "what will you do if only have 24 hours left in life?" 
                    Of course I want to spend the final moment of my life with you, my boy.

                <p>April, 7, 2015. You are my first "love at first sight". After over 12 hours of labor, you came to the world, all bloody but so tiny and cute, you are my baby. </p>

                <h3>Year 0 of Motherhood</h3>
                <p>Days are slow years are fast. My days were an infinite loop of nursing, burping, diaper changing, putting you to sleep, 
                    then nursing, burping,diaper changing and putting you to sleep again...</p>
                <p>Going to Johnson County taking some computer science classes after your dad came home were the little sunshine of my life then, 
                    although I had to bring a breast pump with me and use it in the lactation room during class breaks</p>

                <h3>Year 1 of Motherhood</h3>
                <p>Your started to toddling around like a little duckling, you like to giggle, explore around, putting everything into your mouth.</p>
                <p>We moved to a much bigger house and my parents, your "Gonggong" and "Abu" came to visit us from China, soon before we found out my mom has stage 3 cancer.</p>
                <p>I began to take more and more classes, not sure if it was me want to study, or escaping from parenthood. One night when I back home, I saw you stood by the door
                    wating for mama. I didn't show up to you, but hid myself in the kitchen, until your dad took you to sleep.

                <h3>Year 2 of Motherhood</h3>
                <p>You started to talk quite late, we were worrying for while, perhaps its because mama speaks Chinese and dada speaks English to you then you are confused?</p>
                <p>One time during circle time of Music Together (parent-child music class), a little girl always liked to sit on my lap.
                    You were upset, you told the girl with that cute baby voice:"This my mama!"</p>
                <p>I took you to China to visit my parents and friends. Your enjoyed climbing to the roof in our Beijing Air Bnb. Everyone likes you, but who am I? Beside being Beiji's mama?
